		<h1>Une Lueur d'espoir</h1>

		<p id="Para1">The day welcomes you,<br>
			With a bliss of yellow hue.<br> 
			Morning coffee goes brewing,<br> 
			Life seems to be smooth sailing!</p>

		<p>Highways are traffic and busy,<br>
			Car horns and daily hustles in the city!<br>
			It was all the ordinary,<br>
			Until the 22nd of January.</p>

		<p>Dawn to dusk became unbelievably different,<br> 			Gloominess and sadness were undeniably apparent.<br>
		    Amidst nature and its beauty’s force,<br>  
			The world relentlessly changed its course.</p>

		<p>At six feet apart we stand,<br>
		    Face masks, shields, and sanitizers in demand!<br>
		    With a hushed and distant space,<br> 
			Each one of us shall be safe.</p>

		<p class="Para5">‘Tis our minds and souls,<br>
			Atomic thoughts are trapped in a hole.<br> 
			One and all shall ought for the day<br>
			where tears turn into smiles,<br>
			Thus, sadness turns into great everlasting happiness.</p>
